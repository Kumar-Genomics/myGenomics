# Genomics Hands-on Hub

This repository includes a wide range of practical resources that can be used for different types of genomic analysis in R, Python and Linux.
1. Sequence alignment: Comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify similarities and differences.
2. Genome annotation: Identifying functional elements in a genome sequence, such as genes, regulatory regions, and non-coding RNAs.
3. Phylogenetic analysis: Reconstructing evolutionary relationships between organisms based on genetic or other data.
4. Protein structure prediction: Inferring the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.
5. Gene expression analysis: Studying patterns of gene expression across different tissues, developmental stages, or experimental conditions.
6. Network analysis: Modeling and analyzing biological networks, such as protein-protein interaction networks or metabolic pathways.
7. Variant calling: Identifying genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or structural variants.
8. Epigenetic analysis: Analyzing modifications to DNA and associated proteins that regulate gene expression, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications.
9. Functional enrichment analysis: Identifying enriched biological pathways, gene ontologies, or other functional categories within a set of genes or proteins.
10. Metabolomics analysis: Studying the metabolic profile of cells, tissues, or organisms to identify metabolic pathways and biomarkers.
